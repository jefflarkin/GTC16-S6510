GTC16 S6510 - Targeting GPUs with OpenMP 4.5 Device Directives
==============================================================
The code examples were used during S6510 at GPU Technology Conference
2016. They were tested against a prerelease version of the CLANG compiler,
built from source in March 2016. Due to the unreleased nature of this compiler,
no guarantees are made that the code will continue to work with later
compilers. This code is released WITHOUT WARRANTY.
